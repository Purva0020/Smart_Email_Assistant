Smart Email Assistant is an AI-driven tool that generates quick, context-aware email replies. It includes a React-based website where users paste email text and a Chrome extension with an AI Reply button in Gmail. A Java Spring Boot backend processes the input and returns smart, ready-to-use replies.
